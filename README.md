# SeniorCapstone_LEGO

Miami University Class of 2021 Capstone project.

Contributers: Alejendro Cabreizo, Will Zeurcher, and Thomas Wright.

The goal of this proejct is to create an embedded system that interfaces with the Lego Cad software. This is accomplished in two parts: the harware and the software. THe hardware uses a pcb with infrared lights to send information to a sensor. This sensor then communicates with the designed software. This software constructs HTTP calls to the local machine. With the help of a scripted injector these HTTP calls can interact with the LEGO CAD software effectively.
